Irssi Remote Client (IRC)
=========================

Script and clients for remotely operating Irssi.

The script is a HTTP server running inside Irssi and listens for commands. Most of the internal complexity of Irssi is hidden by the script, and the functionality is exposed via a simplified interface.

The clients can be anything with an internet connection and talks HTTP. Currently there is only an JavaScript HTML5 application that exposes a chat interface.
